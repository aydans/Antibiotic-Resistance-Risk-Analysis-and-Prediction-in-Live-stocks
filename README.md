# Antibiotic Resistance Risk Analysis and Prediction in Live-stocks
This a repository created to organise a data science master thesis. 

# Story
In Italy, the experimental zooprofilattici institutes (IZS) are public health institutions with managerial and administrative autonomy, part of the National Health Service, as a technical and operative instrument for animal health, the control of health and quality of food of animal origin, the hygiene of farms and related activities. The IZS are supervised by the Ministry of Health. There are 10 IZS in Italy by region.

The data for this thesis belong to one of these institutes. Two kind of datasets: one is about the general information about the farms (such as number of animal, number of produstion and the medicine usage) and the other one is test results for antibiotic resistance of bacteries.

Beacuse of the quality of data, there will be lots of challenges, in order to make some useful and meaningful contribution to the institute.
